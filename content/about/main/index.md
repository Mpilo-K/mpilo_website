  I am currently a PhD candidate at __[Stellenbosch University](https://www.sun.ac.za/english)__. My research project is broadly called __[The EucXylo Phenomenological Trial](https://blogs.sun.ac.za/eucxylo/2020/10/12/the-beginning-of-our-phenomenological-trial/)__, where I am studying all the ecophysiological processes and environmental conditions that influence the formation of wood in forest trees.
  
  I am also a **[Data Scientist](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century)** at **[Bantubyte](https://bantubyte.com/)**. I get to work with skillful data scientists, data engineers, advanced analysts , machine learning engineers and software developers to provide custom tailored solutions to various organisations.
  
  In my free time I enjoy cycling, climbing rocks and mountains, physical and mental exercises, and learning new languages (currently German and Afrikaans).
