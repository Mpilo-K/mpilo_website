 I am a Data Scientist with a strong background in Python, R, and SQL, specializing in location intelligence and GIS. I have extensive experience applying machine learning, generative AI, and advanced statistics to deliver actionable insights across diverse industries. My expertise includes collaborating with cross-functional teams and effectively communicating complex data findings to varied audiences.
  
  As a versatile data scientist, data engineer, and advanced analyst, I provide bespoke, custom-tailored solutions to meet the unique needs of various sectors. Currently, I am nearing the completion of my PhD at Stellenbosch University, where my research focuses on The EucXylo Phenomenological Trial. This project explores the ecophysiological processes and environmental conditions that influence wood formation in forest trees.
  
  In my free time, I enjoy cycling, rock and mountain climbing, engaging in physical and mental exercises, and learning new languages, with a current focus on German and Afrikaans.
