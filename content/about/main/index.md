  I am an **[Ecosystems Ecologist _(Ecophysiologist)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem_ecology)**. I am currently doing a PhD at __[Stellenbosch University](https://www.sun.ac.za/english)__. My current research project is called __[The EucXylo Phenomenological Trial](https://blogs.sun.ac.za/eucxylo/2020/10/12/the-beginning-of-our-phenomenological-trial/)__, where I am studying all the ecophysiological processes and environmental conditions that influence the formation of wood in forest trees.  
  
  Outside my research, I freelance as a __[Data Analyst](https://github.com/Mpilo-K)__. In this role I help individuals, businesses, and organisations make data-driven decisions using __high quality data__, state-of-the-art __visualisations__ and __advanced data analytics__. I program in __R__, __SQL__, and __Python__, especially literate, reproducible and accissible programming using tools such as __Rmarkdown__, __Jupyter Notebooks__ and __LaTeX__. I also teach these tools and skills to beginners. 
  
  In my free time, I enjoy mountain cycling, calisthenics, climbing rocks and mountains, playing a Ukulele, and learning new languages (currently German and Afrikaans).
